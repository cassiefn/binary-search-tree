# Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree data structure is implemented along with some associated functionality. The user can choose between: adding to tree, removing from tree, searching for element in tree, and displaying tree in in-oder, pre-order, or post-order. This was part of a data structure and algorithms project for Montana State University in Fall 2018.
